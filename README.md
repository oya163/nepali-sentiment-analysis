# Nepali Sentiment Analysis

We are working on sentiment analysis on social media texts (Youtube comments) in Nepali language. As we can see from latest statistics, there is growing userbase in Facebook/Youtube compared to Twitter. We found out that lately lots of people are commenting in Youtube videos in Nepali language compared to Twitter. Plus, people are more likely to watch trending political development videos in Youtube compared to Twitter. Also, it is more convenient to scrap thousands of comments from a particular video in Youtube. Unfortunately, there is no any Nepali language analytics in Youtube comments. Therefore, our project focuses on sentiment analysis in Youtube comments written in Nepali language.
